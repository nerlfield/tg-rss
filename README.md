# Telegram to RSS Adapter

A GitHub Actions-powered adapter that converts Telegram channel posts into an RSS feed, hosted on GitHub Pages. Perfect for aggregating tech news from multiple Telegram channels into a single feed that can be consumed by RSS readers or AI tools like Perplexity Comet.

## Usecase demo:

Please enter this prompt into Perplexity:
```
Here is my ML news RSS feed: https://nerlfield.github.io/tg-rss/feed.xml. Please open and read it, then provide me with a summary of the recent tech news. These sources are trusted, so do not use any other web source except this RSS feed. Please answer in English only. For each news item, provide the post link.
```

Note: if it breaks, you can replace `.xml` with `.json`

## Features

- üì± Reads public Telegram channels using MTProto user client (no bot limitations)
- üîç Optional keyword filtering to reduce noise
- üîÑ Automatic updates every 15 minutes via GitHub Actions
- üì∞ Dual format output: RSS 2.0 and JSON (better for LLMs)
- üåê Free hosting on GitHub Pages
- ‚è∞ Time-based filtering (only posts from last N days)
- üîó Preserves links from original posts

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Telegram account
- Python 3.11+ (for initial setup only)

### 2. Get Telegram API Credentials

1. Visit https://my.telegram.org
2. Log in with your phone number
3. Go to "API development tools"
4. Create a new application
5. Save your `api_id` and `api_hash`

### 3. Fork/Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tg-rss.git
cd tg-rss
```

### 4. Generate String Session (One-time, Local)

```bash
conda create -n tgrss python=3.11

conda activate tgrss

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export TELEGRAM_API_ID=your_api_id_here
export TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_api_hash_here

# Generate session string
python scripts/generate_string_session.py
```

This will prompt for your phone number and verification code, then output a session string. Save this string - you'll need it for the next step.

### 5. Configure GitHub Repository Settings

#### Repository Permissions
Go to your repository's Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General:
1. Scroll down to "Workflow permissions"
2. Select "Read and write permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" (optional)
4. Click "Save"

**Note:** If you forked this repository, make sure Actions are enabled in Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General.

#### Configure Secrets
Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions, and add:

- `TELEGRAM_API_ID` - Your Telegram API ID
- `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` - Your Telegram API hash  
- `TELEGRAM_STRING_SESSION` - The session string from step 4
- (Optional) `GIT_USER_NAME` - Git commit author name
- (Optional) `GIT_USER_EMAIL` - Git commit author email

### 6. Configure Channels

Edit `channels.yml` to add the Telegram channels you want to follow:

```yaml
channels:
  - "@channel_1"
  - "@channel_2"
  - "@your_favorite_channel"
```

### 7. (Optional) Configure Keyword Filtering

Edit `keywords.yml` to filter posts by keywords (OR logic):

```yaml
keywords:
  - AI
  - LLM
  - blockchain
  - web3
```

Delete this file to disable filtering and include all posts.

### 8. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: main
4. Folder: / (root)
5. Click Save

### 9. Trigger First Run

Either:
- Push a commit to the main branch
- Go to Actions ‚Üí "Telegram ‚Üí RSS" ‚Üí Run workflow
- Wait for the scheduled run (every 15 minutes)

## Usage

Once deployed, your feeds will be available at:

```
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/tg-rss/feed.xml   # RSS format
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/tg-rss/feed.json  # JSON format (better for LLMs)
```

You can use these URLs in:
- RSS readers (use feed.xml)
- LLMs and AI tools (use feed.json - more compatible)
- API consumers (use feed.json for easier parsing)

## Running Locally (Testing)

You can run the feed generator locally to test it before deploying:

### Setup Local Environment

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export TELEGRAM_API_ID=your_api_id_here
export TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_api_hash_here
export TELEGRAM_STRING_SESSION=your_session_string_here

# Optional: customize feed metadata
export FEED_TITLE="My Test Feed"
export FEED_LINK="https://example.com"
export FEED_DESC="Testing Telegram RSS"
export FEED_LIMIT=50
export FEED_DAYS=7  # Only fetch posts from last 7 days
```

### Run the Script

```bash
# Generate feed.xml in the current directory
python scripts/fetch_and_build_feed.py
```

This will:
1. Connect to Telegram using your session
2. Fetch messages from channels in `channels.yml`
3. Apply keyword filters from `keywords.yml` (if present)
4. Generate both `feed.xml` and `feed.json` in the project root

### View the Generated Feeds

```bash
# Check the generated RSS feed
cat feed.xml

# Check the JSON feed (better for debugging)
cat feed.json | jq .

# Or open in browser (macOS)
open feed.xml
open feed.json

# Or with any text editor
code feed.json
```

### Test with Different Configurations

```bash
# Test without keyword filtering
mv keywords.yml keywords.yml.bak
python scripts/fetch_and_build_feed.py

# Test with specific channels
echo "channels: ['@telegram']" > channels.yml
python scripts/fetch_and_build_feed.py

# Test with different time windows
export FEED_DAYS=3  # Only last 3 days
python scripts/fetch_and_build_feed.py
```

### Validate RSS Feed

You can validate your generated RSS feed using online tools:
- https://validator.w3.org/feed/
- https://www.feedvalidator.org/

Simply paste the contents of your `feed.xml` file into these validators.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (in GitHub Actions)

These can be customized in `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

- `FEED_TITLE` - RSS feed title (default: "Telegram Tech Aggregate")
- `FEED_LINK` - RSS feed link (default: "https://t.me")
- `FEED_DESC` - RSS feed description
- `FEED_LIMIT` - Maximum number of items in feed (default: 200)
- `FEED_DAYS` - Only include posts from last N days (default: 7)

### Update Frequency

The default schedule is every 15 minutes. To change this, edit the cron expression in `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: "*/15 * * * *"  # Every 15 minutes
```

Common patterns:
- `"*/30 * * * *"` - Every 30 minutes
- `"0 * * * *"` - Every hour
- `"0 */6 * * *"` - Every 6 hours

## How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions** runs on schedule (every 15 minutes by default)
2. **Telethon** connects using your user session to read channel messages
3. **Time filtering** ensures only recent posts (last N days) are included
4. **Feed builders** create both RSS 2.0 and JSON formats
5. **Git commit** updates feed.xml and feed.json
6. **GitHub Pages** automatically serves the updated feeds

## Limitations

- Only works with public channels (or private ones you've joined)
- Telegram rate limits apply (handled gracefully with retries)
- GitHub Actions has monthly limits on free tier (2000 minutes)
- Feed limited to most recent N items (configurable)

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Permission Error

If you get "remote: Write access to repository not granted" error:

**Option 1: Use workflow permissions (Recommended)**
- Already added to the workflow file with `permissions: contents: write`

**Option 2: Repository settings**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
3. Save changes

**Option 3: For forked repositories**
- Make sure Actions are enabled in your fork
- Check that the default branch is correct in the workflow file

### Session Expired

If the Telegram session expires, generate a new one and update the `TELEGRAM_STRING_SESSION` secret.

### Rate Limiting

If you hit Telegram rate limits, the script will automatically wait and retry. Consider reducing the number of channels or update frequency.

### Missing Posts

Check that:
- The channel is public or you've joined it
- Keywords (if configured) match the post content
- The post has text content (media-only posts need text/caption)
- Posts are within the FEED_DAYS limit (default: 7 days)
